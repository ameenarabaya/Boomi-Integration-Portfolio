## Integration Flow
- Fetches customer data from a MySQL database using Boomi Database (Legacy) connector
- Converts database records into a JSON profile
- Maps database fields to JSON fields
- Validates key fields such as phone number and customer name
- Handles basic error scenarios
- Ends the process after successful transformation

## Sample Data Mapping
- CONTACT_ID → CONTACT_ID
- CUSTOMER_ID → CUSTOMER_ID
- FIRST_NAME → FIRST_NAME
- LAST_NAME → LAST_NAME
- PHONE → PHONE

## Learning Outcome
This project demonstrates my ability to work with database connectors,
transform relational data into JSON format, and design clean integration
flows using Boomi AtomSphere.
